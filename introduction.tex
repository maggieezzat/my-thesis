Natural Language Processing (NLP) and contextual analysis
techniques have matured greatly over the last decade, with
applications rising in many industries. The evolution of transport
network operators to more automation requires an AI-enabled
control center room.
In this project, we aim to enhance the capability of our system,
enabling it to understand human speech from vehicle driver input and
trigger dispatcher actions automatically. As such, an AI dispatcher
agent needs to understand a message/call from a driver in order to
trigger the necessary action.

A second valuable application of such NLP engine, is increased automation inside the control center. As such, an artificially-intelligent (AI) dispatcher agent needs to understand a message/call from a driver in order to trigger the necessary action.
